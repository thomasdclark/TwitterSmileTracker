#TwitterEmotionTracker

##Current Functionality
Receives a stream of tweets containing smilely faces and frowny faces, records how many occur since the start time, and calculates a ratio of smiles-to-frowns.  Displayed in a simple GUI.

##Future Functionality
Recieves a stream of tweets containing key emotion words that can be interpreted as a spectrum.  Compares the tweet frequency of all of the words and determines the overall feeling of Twitter at that moment in time.
